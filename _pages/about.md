I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Trustworthy Engineering of Software Technologies ([TEST](https://nus-test.github.io/)) Lab at the National University of Singapore (NUS), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). Prior to my PhD, I earned my Bachelor’s degree at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), advised by [Prof. Yuqun Zhang](https://zhangyuqun.github.io/index.html). I have also worked as a research assistant in Human-Computer Interaction advised by [Prof. Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/) at the University of Notre Dame.

My research interests lies at the intersection of software engineering, databases and LLMs, especially in developing practical solutions to enhance software development process and reliablity. Currently, I am working on unified interfaces for diverse SQL dialects to faciliate database-related applications.
