I am a senior undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuqun Zhang](https://zhangyuqun.github.io/index.html).

My research interests lie in Software Engineering, especially in developing practical solutions to make software and its development process reliable. I have been exposed to research areas on **End-user Programming**, **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**, and would like to explore new topics in the future. Currently, I am working on a programming interface that utilizes programmers' coginitive state to enable enhanced code cross-referencing capabilities, advised by [Prof. Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/) at the University of Notre Dame.
