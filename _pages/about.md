I am a senior undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuqun Zhang](https://zhangyuqun.github.io/index.html). I have also work as a research assistant advised by [Prof. Toby Jia-Jun Li](https://toby.li/) at the University of Notre Dame.

My research interests lie in Software Engineering, especially in developing practical solutions to make software and its development process reliable. I have been exposed to research areas on **Programming Tools**, **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**, and would like to explore new topics in the future.
